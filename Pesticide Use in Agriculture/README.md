# Pesticide Use in Agriculture Analysis

## About the Dataset

This dataset provides comprehensive annual county-level estimates for the usage of 423 pesticide active ingredients applied to agricultural crops across the contiguous United States from 2014 to 2015. The dataset uniquely quantifies pesticide usage with both low and high estimate methods for all states except California, offering a detailed look into the range of pesticide application.

**Estimation Methods**:
- **Low Estimates**: These are conservative figures where unreported pesticide use within a district is assumed to be zero. This method provides a baseline scenario of pesticide usage.
- **High Estimates**: These figures treat unreported pesticide uses as missing data, estimating usage based on similar neighboring locations within the same agricultural region. This approach offers a potential upper limit of pesticide use, accommodating for underreporting.

## Project Task

The objective of this project is to thoroughly analyze and understand the provided dataset to uncover underlying patterns and trends in pesticide usage across different regions and years. This analysis aims to clean, visualize, and interpret the data comprehensively. A key component of the project is to employ geographic visualization to illustrate regional differences and shifts in pesticide usage over time.

## Method

1. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and address any inconsistencies or missing data points in the dataset.
2. **Data Exploration**: Perform statistical analyses to understand central tendencies, dispersions, and correlations between different types of pesticides and their usage.
3. **Visualization**:
    - Create bar plots to track the top 10 major pesticides.
    - Use box charts and pie charts to compare the proportion of different pesticides used in various states.
    - Develop filled geographic maps to visualize the density and distribution of pesticide usage across the U.S. counties.
4. **Geographic Analysis**: Use GIS tools to overlay pesticide usage data on agricultural intensity maps to draw correlations and possibly predict future trends.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the pesticide usage data between 2014 and 2015 to identify any significant changes or patterns.

## Conclusion

The analysis of these maps provides crucial visual evidence for understanding the dynamics of pesticide usage in American agriculture. It highlights the geographic disparities in pesticide application and their temporal changes, which are vital for:
- **Environmental Scientists**: To assess the impact of pesticides on ecological systems.
- **Agricultural Experts**: To optimize crop protection strategies.
- **Policymakers**: To draft regulations that balance agricultural needs with environmental safety.

Continued monitoring and analysis of this data are essential to guide future agricultural practices and policy-making, aiming to mitigate potential adverse environmental and health impacts associated with pesticide usage.

By presenting a clear and structured analysis, this README aims to ensure that the dataset's insights are accessible and actionable for stakeholders involved in agricultural and environmental planning.
